# Definite Integral
The area created by a function in a certain closed interval can be found by **definite integral**.

$$ \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx $$

**a** is called Lower end. **b** is called top end.
**x** is called integral variable. **f(x)** is called **integrand**

Also, finding the value of a definite integral is called "**integrating f(x) from a to b**".

If we express this equation without using integrals, we get the following equation below.

$$ \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = \lim_{{\delta x_k} \to 0} \sum_{k=1}^{n}f(x_k)\delta x_k $$
