## Primitive Function
For Example, primitive function in above is like a below.

$$ f(x) = 3x $$

$$ F(x) = \frac 3 2 x^2 $$

## Indefinite Integral
primitive function in a formula is not just the above.
For example, below primitive function in below formula is the same as above.

$$ F(x) = \frac 3 2 x^2 + 5 $$

Even if we differentiate this formula, we get the same formula as before.

Something like "5" is called a **constant of integration**.

So, the result of integrating the first formula is as follows.

$$ F(x) = \frac 3 2 x^2 + C $$
