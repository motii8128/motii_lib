# About Modern Constitutionalism
Human beings are born with the right to live like humans. These are called **natural rights（自然権）**.

The idea arose that poeple suffering from the tyranny of the king should create a **nation(国家)** to protect their natural rights.

The promise made at that time is called a **social contract（社会契約）**. The **consitution（憲法）** is a written document that summarizes the social contract.
