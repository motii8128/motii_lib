# Day 1

## Angular Velocity
Angular Velocity is generated when an object moves in a uniform circular motion.

It also represents the angle of rotation per unit time. The symbol is **ω** and the unit is **rad/s**.

From what I said earlier, the formula for angular velocity is as follows.

$$ ω = \frac \theta t$$

## Relationship between angular velocity and velocity
Of cource, objects moving in a circle also have velocity.

The distance that an object has moved is expressed as follows using the radius of the circle and the angle of rotation.

$$ l = r\theta $$

Therefore, velocity can be easily calculated by dividing distance by delta time.

$$ v = \frac l t $$

In addition, when it is transformed and made into a shape using angular velocity, it is as follows.

$$ v = \frac l t = r \frac \theta t = rω$$

## Period and rotation speed
The period represents how many seconds it takes to complete one revolution, so use the angular velocity and radian as follows.

$$ T = \frac {2π} ω[s] $$

Also, express that by using velocity as follows.

$$ T = \frac {2\pi r} v[s] $$

The rotation speed is the reciprocal of the period, so it is as follows.

$$ n = \frac 1 T[Hz] $$
