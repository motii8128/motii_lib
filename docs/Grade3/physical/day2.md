## Acceleration in uniform circular motion
In acceleration in uniform circular motion, velocity is constant. But, direction keeps changing. So **acceleration[m\s^2]** is occurring.

About obejct moving in a uniform circular motion with an angular velocity ***ω[ rad/s ]*** on the circumference of a circle with radius ***r[ m ]***.

Acceleration in uniform circular motion is indicated like a below.

$$
\vec{a} = \frac {\delta \vec{v}} {\delta t} [m/s^2]
$$

At that time, size of delta velocity vector approaches arc length that indicated below equation.

$$ v \times \delta \theta  = v \times ω \times \delta t$$

So acceleration is ...

$$
a = \frac {\delta v} {\delta t} = v ω [m/s^2] ・・・(A)
$$

Substituting **(B)** for **(A)**.

$$
v = rω ・・・(B)
$$

$$
a = \frac {v^2} r
$$

Therefore, acceleration keeps same value. Also, vector in acceleration is facing the center in circle.

## Force required for uniform circular motion
About the motion earlier, let mass of object be **m[ kg ]**, let force receving be below.

$$ \vec{F} [N]$$

From the equation of motion like a below, objects always experiences a constant force in the same direction as the acceleration.
$$ m \vec{a} = \vec{F}$$

In this case, object always experiences force that is facing the center in circle. That is called **Centripetal Force(向心力)**.

Substituting equation ealier for equation of motion.

$$
\begin{align}
F &= mrω^2 \\
&= m \frac {v^2} r
\end{align}
$$

## Key points of uniform circular motion

- If you see object moving uniform circular motion, "**moving on circumference because force that is facing the center in circle exist.**"

- **Find the forces acting on the object** and consider that their resultant force points toward the center of the circle.

- **Build equation of motion.**

For example, 
$$
\frac {mv^2} r = ResultantForce \\
mrω^2 = ResultantForce
$$
